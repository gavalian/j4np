\begin{abstract}
In this article, we present the results of using Convolutional Auto-Encoders for de-noising raw data for CLAS12 drift chambers.
The de-noising neural network provides increased efficiency in track reconstruction, also improved performance for high 
luminosity experimental data collection. The de-noising neural network used in conjunction with the previously developed track 
classifier neural network~\cite{Gavalian:2022hfa} lead to a significant track reconstruction efficiency increase for current luminosity
($0.6\times10^{35}~cm^{-2}~sec^{-1}$ ). The increase in experimentally measured quantities will allow running experiments at twice 
the luminosity with the same track reconstruction efficiency. This will lead to huge savings in accelerator operational costs, and large 
savings for Jefferson Lab and collaborating institutions.
