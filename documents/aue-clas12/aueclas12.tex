\begin{abstract}

  In this article we describe the implementation of Artificial Intelligence models in track reconstruction software for the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab.
 The Artificial Intelligence based approach resulted in improved track reconstruction efficiency in high luminosity experimental conditions.  The track
 reconstruction efficiency increased by $15\%$ for single particle, and statistics in multi-particle physics reactions increased by $15\%-35\%$ depending 
 on the number of particles in the reaction. The implementation of artificial intelligence in the workflow also resulted in code speedup of $35\%$.
