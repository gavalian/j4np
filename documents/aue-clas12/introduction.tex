\section{Introduction}

During the past few years, there was a big interest in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 
various areas of nuclear physics, from data processing to physics analysis. With continuously 
improving methods of Machine Learning (ML) and computational hardware, it becomes easy to 
substitute some computational tasks with ML algorithms leading to a smaller and computationally
more efficient codebase. In this article, we discuss the implementation of Convolutional Auto-Encoders 
for de-noising data from CLAS12~\cite{Burkert:2020akg} tracking detectors (Drift 
Chambers~\cite{Mestayer:2020saf}). The de-nosing was used to analyze simulated data to measure
improvement in track reconstruction efficiency.
