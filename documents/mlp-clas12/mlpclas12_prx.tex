\begin{abstract}
  In this article we describe the implementation of Artificial Intelligence models in track reconstruction
  software for the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. The Artificial Intelligence based approach resulted 
  in improved track reconstruction efficiency in high luminosity experimental conditions.  The track
 reconstruction efficiency increased by $10-15\%$ for single particle, and statistics in multi-particle physics 
 reactions increased by $15\%-35\%$ depending on the number of particles in the reaction. The implementation 
 of artificial intelligence in the workflow also resulted in a speedup of the tracking by $35\%$, we estimated these 
 improvements are equivalent of more than $\$4$M  annual savings for realization of the CLAS12 physics program.

\section{Introduction}
\indent

Nuclear Physics experiments have become increasingly complex over the past decades, with more complex detector 
systems and higher luminosities. In emerging experiments where data collection rates are higher, there is a need for 
new approaches for data processing that can improve data reconstruction accuracy and speed. New developments in 
the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field present promising alternatives to conventional algorithms for data processing. 
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are being employed in various stages of experimental data processing, such as: 
the detector data reconstruction, particle identification, detector simulations and physics analysis. 

In this paper we present the implementation of machine learning models into the CLAS12 charged-particle track 
reconstruction software. Detailed analysis of the reconstruction performance are presented, comparing track 
reconstruction efficiency and speed improvements to conventional algorithms.
