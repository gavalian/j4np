\begin{abstract}

  In this article we describe implementation of Artificial Intelligence models in track reconstruction software for CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab.
 The Artificial Intelligence based approach resulted in improved track reconstruction efficiency in high luminosity experimental conditions.  The track
 reconstruction efficiency increased by $15\%$ for single particle, and statistics in multi-particle physics reactions increased by $15\%-35\%$ depending 
 on number of particles in the reaction. Implementation of artificial intelligence in workflow also resulted in code speedup of $35\%$.

\section{Introduction}
\indent

Nuclear Physics experiment have become more complex over the past decades, using higher beam energies and higher beam currents. In new emerging experiments where data collection rates are higher there is a need to new approaches of data processing that can improve data reconstruction accuracy and speed. New developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field present a promising alternatives to conventional algorithms in data processing. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are being employed in various stages of experimental data processing, such as: detector data reconstruction, particle identification, detector simulations and physics data analysis. 

In this paper we present implementation of previously develop Machine Learning models into CLAS12 track reconstruction software. Detailed analysis 
of reconstruction performance are presented comparing track reconstruction efficiency and speed improvements compared to conventional algorithms.
