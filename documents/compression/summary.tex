\section{Summary}

A new method for raw pulse data compression was developed for CLAS12 using autoencoder neural networks. The neural network is capable
of compressing the raw pulse information by a factor of $4$, with insignificant loss of resolution (about $2\%$ in real data).
The network is capable of compressing multiple pulses in one time window. This method can be used in future high-luminosity runs
in CLAS12 where the data volume is large and multi-pulse data is significantly higher in number. This method can be used for other
experiments at Jefferson Lab and in future experiments such as EIC where the data rates are expected to be high.
