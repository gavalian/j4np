# Examples

Examples forlder contains simple exmaples designed for each
package to test functionality. All examples are implemented
as scripts for JSHELL (cool stuff). In order to run them use
command:

 >jshell --class-path j4np-physics/target/j4np-physics-0.9-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -s examples/physics/vector_example.jshell
